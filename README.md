# SuperDry

I am a big fan of [the Philosophy of Ruby](http://www.artima.com/intv/rubyP.html). Matz, the creator of the language, said "I want to concentrate the things I do, not the magical rules of the language." And that is the motivation I created "SuperDry".

SuperDry, as the name indicates, it is super [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). Compare to the modern JavaScript Frameworks like React, you only need to write 1/3 of the code for the same features set, and the vocabulary of the SuperDry is limited to only 10. So -

* Less code, less opportunity to introduce bugs
* Easier to learn, easier to focus on the innovations "I do".

Those are the benefits SuperDry brings.
  
# How to write a TodoMVC

[TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) is a test stone that every JavaScript Framework try to provide as an example, and compete with each others on features. SuperDry wins in [many aspects](https://github.com/forrestc/superdry/wiki/Comparison) among many other top frameworks.
