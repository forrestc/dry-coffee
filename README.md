# SuperDry

I am a big fan of [the Philosophy of Ruby](http://www.artima.com/intv/rubyP.html). Matz, the creator of the language, said "I want to concentrate the things I do, not the magical rules of the language." And that is the motivation I created SuperDry.

SuperDry is built on top of half dozen of existing great JavaScript frameworks, libraries and tools, but programmers do not need to remember all the keywords, understand their working process and machanism, or be an expert in all the details. They just want to concentrate on the task, so I tried to make SuperDry code concise and succinct. To write a Javascript application, it only uses 1/3 of lines, among which the max width can be limited in no more than 80 chars (nearly impossible in other frameworks).

The vacabulary of SuperDry is extremely small, it has only 3 classes that you need to inherit from, and each class has only less than 5 keywords. That is all you need to learn before write your own complicated Javascript applications. By "all you need to learn", I suppose you have already had a little basic knowledge of CSS and HTML.

# The Three Classes

## Store

Keywords: `setup`, `load`, `on[Field]<Action>`

## Theme

Keywords: `extends`, `apply`, `with`

## Component

Keywords: `render`
